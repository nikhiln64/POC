# FLAMES

FLAMES is a game named after the acronym: Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, Siblings. It is a popular game among young girls/boys at sleepovers, especially with pre-teens and teens who are beginning to explore the world of crushes. This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.

To play Flame, start by writing your name and the name of your “flames,” or crush and the application will calculate FLAMES and pops up a notification.
